### Configuration
You can configure important aspects of the theme via
[`_config.yml`](https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack/blob/v3/_config.yml).
This includes:

* the blog description in the sidebar

### How to Change the Image and Color of a Post
In the manifest of a blog post, simply add an url as `image` and a CSS color as `color`:

~~~yml
layout: post
title: Introducing Hydejack
image: https://qwtel.com/hydejack/assets/img/hyde.jpg
color: '#949667'
~~~

### How to Add a New Tag
Tags are not meant to be used #instagram #style: #food #goodfood #happy #happylife #didimentionfood #yougetthepoint,
as each tag requires some setup work. I tend to think of it as categories that can be combined.

1.  Add an entry to `_data/tags.yml`, where the key represents a slug and provide at least a `name` value and
    optionally `image`, `color` and `description`.

    Example `/_data/tags.yml`:

    ~~~yml
    mytag:
      name: My Tag
    ~~~
